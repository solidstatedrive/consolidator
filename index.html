<h3>
<a id="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PURPOSE</h3>

<p>This bookmarklet allows you to open multiple to-dos/evaluations at the same time.  This approach saves time, bandwidth and mouse clicks for the user.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-this-is-not" class="anchor" href="#what-this-is-not" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHAT THIS IS NOT</h3>

<p>This bookmarklet DOES NOT automate the filling and submission of evaluations.  This bookmarklet does not pre-fill any responses to evaluations.  To suggest otherwise is a gross misrepresentation of the capabilities of this bookmarklet.</p>
